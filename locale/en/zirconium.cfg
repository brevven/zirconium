# Settings
[mod-setting-name]
bzzirconium-recipe-bypass=Bypass recipes
bzzirconium-byproduct=Output byproducts
bzzirconium-enable-intermediates=Enable cermet
bzzirconium-enable-sorting=Enable stone sorting
bzzirconium-early=Early zircon
bzzirconium-ammo=Enable magazine
bzzirconium-basic-foundry=Enable basic foundry

[mod-setting-description]
bzzirconium-recipe-bypass=Skip modifying these recipes (comma-separated list).
bzzirconium-byproduct=If enabled and using Titanium mod, zirconia production will output titanium as a byproduct.
bzzirconium-enable-intermediates=Enable cermet, an advanced intermediate made from ceramics and metals.
bzzirconium-enable-sorting=Enable "sorting" recipes to convert between zircon and stone. This is no longer as useful for burner phase as it used to be, but left as an option for certain map layouts or existing factories.
bzzirconium-early=If [color=green]enabled[/color], zircon is required in small quantities early in the game.\nIf [color=orange]disabled[/color], zircon is not required until after logistic science.
bzzirconium-ammo=If enabled, adds a new explosive ammunition magazine.
bzzirconium-basic-foundry=Defaults to enabled unless another suitable crafting machine is present (such as a Kiln from Wooden Industry).
